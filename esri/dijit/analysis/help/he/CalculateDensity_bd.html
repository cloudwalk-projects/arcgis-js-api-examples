        <h2>Calculate Density</h2><p/>
        <h2><img src="../images/GUID-38AD3C19-0400-4E5A-9282-BDE42F2BBFC1-web.png" alt="Calculate Density"></h2>
        <hr/>
    <p>The Calculate Density tool creates a density map from point features by spreading known quantities of some phenomenon (represented as attributes of the points) across the map. The result is a layer of areas classified from least dense to most dense.   

    </p>
    <p>For point input, each point should represent the location of some event or incident, and the result layer represents a count of the incident per unit area.  A higher density value in a new location means that there are more points near that location.  In many cases, the result layer can be interpreted as a risk surface for future events. For example, if the input points represent locations of lightning strikes, the result layer can be interpreted as a risk surface for future lightning strikes.
    </p>
    <p>Other use cases of this tool include the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Creating crime-density maps to help police departments properly allocate resources to high crime areas.
            </li>
            <li>Calculating densities of hospitals within a county.  The result layer will show areas with high and low accessibility to hospitals, and this information can be used to decide where new hospitals should be built.
            </li>
            <li>Identifying areas that are at high risk of forest fires based on historical locations of forest fires.
            </li>
            <li>Locating communities that are far from major highways in order to plan where new roads should be constructed.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p>The point layer on which the density will be calculated.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to choosing a layer from your map, you can choose  <b>Browse Layers</b> at the bottom of the drop-down list to browse to your contents for a big data file share dataset or feature layer.

        <div>
            <p>Provide  one or more fields specifying the number of incidents at each location.  For example, if you have points that represent cities, you 
can use a field representing the population of the city as the count field, and the resulting population density layer will calculate larger population densities near cities with larger populations.
            </p>
            <p>The density for the count of points will always be calculated.   If no fields are selected, each location will be assumed to represent a single count.

                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Uniform</b>&mdash;This calculates a magnitude per area.

        <div>
            <p>The desired output units of the density values. By default, this is set to the units in your map (for example, square meters). If density values are very small, you can increase the size of the area units (for example, square meters to square kilometers) to return larger values. The values only scale the result.

        <div>
            <p>If time is enabled on the input point layer and it is of type instant, you can  analyze using time slicing.  There are three parameters you can set when you use time:
                <ul>
                    <li>  <b>Time Interval</b>
                    </li>

                    <li> <b>Reference Time</b>

                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>Imagine you had data that represented a year in time and you wanted to analyze using weekly slices. To do that you would set  <b>Time Interval</b> to <code>1 week</code>.
            </p>
            <p> Imagine you had data that represented a year in time and you wanted to analyze using the first week of the month. To do that you would set <b>Time Interval</b> to <code>1 week</code>, <b>Time Step</b> to <code>1 month</code>, and <b>Reference Time</b> to <code>January 1, at 12:00 am</code>.

            <p> If you wanted to create time slices that took place every Monday from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m., <b>Time Interval</b> would be <code>1 hour</code>, <b>Time Step</b> would be <code>1 week</code>, and <b>Reference Time</b> would be <code>9:00:00 a.m. on a Monday</code>.

            <p> If you wanted to create time slices that took place every Monday from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m., <b>Time Interval</b> would be <code>1 hour</code>, <b>Time Step</b> would be <code>1 week</code>, and <b>Reference Time</b> would be <code>9:00:00 a.m. on a Monday</code>.

    <div id="spatialReference">
        <div><h2>SpatialReference (wkid)</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>This is a temporary parameter for prerelease  to set the processing spatial reference. Many big data tools require that a projected coordinate system is used as the spatial reference for processing. By default, the tool will use the input coordinate system but will fail if it's a geographic coordinate system. To set a projected coordinate system, enter the WKID. For example,  <b>Web Mercator</b> would be entered as <code>3857</code>.
