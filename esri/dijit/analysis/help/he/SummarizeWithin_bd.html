        <div>
            <p>If time is enabled on the input point layer and it is of type instant, you can  analyze using time slicing.  There are three parameters you can set when you use time:
                <ul>
                    <li>  <b>Time Interval</b>
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Time Step</b>
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Reference Time</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>Imagine you had data that represented a year in time and you wanted to analyze using weekly slices. To do that you would set  <b>Time Interval</b> to <code>1 week</code>.
            </p>
            <p> Imagine you had data that represented a year in time and you wanted to analyze using the first week of the month. To do that you would set <b>Time Interval</b> to <code>1 week</code>, <b>Time Step</b> to <code>1 month</code>, and <b>Reference Time</b> to <code>January 1, at 12:00 am</code>.
            </p>

            <p> If you wanted to create time slices that took place every Monday from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m., <b>Time Interval</b> would be <code>1 hour</code>, <b>Time Step</b> would be <code>1 week</code>, and <b>Reference Time</b> would be <code>9:00:00 a.m. on a Monday</code>.

    <div id="summaryFields">
        <div><h2>Add statistics from the layer to summarize (optional)</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p> You can calculate statistics on features that are summarized. On numeric fields you can calculate the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count
                    </li>
                    <li>Mean
                    </li>
                    <li>Min
                    </li>
                    <li>Max
                    </li>
                    <li>Range
                    </li>
                    <li>Variance
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>On string fields you can calculate the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count
                    </li>
                    <li>Any&mdash;This statistic is a random sample of a string value in the specified field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on nonnull values. The resulting layer will contain a new field for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic. 
            </p>
            <p>In addition to these statistics, proportional statistics will be calculated on all numeric fields:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count&mdash;The count of each field multiplied by the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Sum&mdash;The sum of weighted of values in each field. Where the weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Mean&mdash;The weighted mean of values in each field. Where the weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Min&mdash;The minimum of weighted values in each field. Where the weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Max&mdash;The maximum of weighted values in each field. Where the weight applied is the proportion of the summary layer within the polygons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Range&mdash;The difference between the maximum and minimum weighted values.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>Depending on the types of features you are summarizing, the total count of nearby points, total length of lines, or total area will be calculated.
            </p>

    <div id="spatialReference">
        <div><h2>SpatialReference (wkid)</h2></div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p>This is a temporary parameter for prerelease  to set the processing spatial reference. Many big data tools require that a projected coordinate system is used as the spatial reference for processing. By default, the tool will use the input coordinate system but will fail if it's a geographic coordinate system. To set a projected coordinate system, enter the WKID. For example,  <b>Web Mercator</b> would be entered as <code>3857</code>.
