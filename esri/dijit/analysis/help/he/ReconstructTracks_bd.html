        <h2><img src="../images/GUID-80807DB7-0CA7-4FD8-9702-B4486285D4FC-web.png" alt="Reconstruct Tracks"></h2>
        <hr/>
    <p>This tool works with a time-enabled layer of
either point  or polygon features that represent an  <code>instant</code> in time.   It first
determines which features belong to a track using an identifier. Using the time at each location, the tracks are ordered sequentially and transformed into a line or polygon representing the path of movement over time. Optionally, the input may be buffered by a  field, which will create a polygon at each location. These buffered points, or if the inputs are polygons, are then joined sequentially to create a track as a polygon where the width is representative of the attribute of interest. Resulting tracks have a start and end time, which represent temporally the first and last feature in a given track. When the tracks are created, statistics about the input features are calculated and assigned to the output track. The
most basic statistic is the count  of points within
the area, but other statistics can be calculated  as well.
    </p>
    <p>Features in time-enabled layers can be represented in one of two ways:
        <ul>
            <li>Instant&mdash;A single moment in time
            </li>
            <li>Interval&mdash;A start and end time
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you have GPS measurements of hurricanes every 10 minutes. Each GPS measurement records the hurricane's name, location, time of recording, and  wind speed. With this information, you could create tracks for each hurricane using the name for  track identification, and tracks for each hurricane  would be generated. Additionally, you could calculate statistics such as the mean, max, and minimum wind speed of each hurricane, as well as the count of measurements within each track.
    </p>
    <p>Using the same example, you could buffer your tracks by the wind speed. This would buffer each measurement by the wind speed field at that location, and join the buffered areas together, creating a polygon representative of the track path, as well as the changes in wind speed as the hurricanes progressed.

            <p> You can calculate statistics on features that are summarized. On numeric fields you can calculate the following:

                    <li>Count
                    </li>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on nonnull values. The resulting layer will contain a new field for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic.
