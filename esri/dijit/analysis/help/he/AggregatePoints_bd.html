        <hr/>
    <p>This tool works with a layer of
point features  and a layer of areas features.  Input area features can be from a polygon layer or they can be square or hexagonal bins calculated when the tool is run. The tool first
determines which points fall within each specified area. After determining
this point-in-area spatial relationship, statistics about all
points in the area are calculated and assigned to the area. The
most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within
the area, but you can get other statistics as well. 

    </p>
    <p>For example, suppose you have point features of coffee shop locations and area features of counties, and you want to summarize coffee sales by county.  Assuming the  coffee shops have a    <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> attribute, you can get the sum of all <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> within each county, the minimum or maximum <i>TOTAL_SALES</i>
 within each county, or other statistics such as the count, range, standard deviation, and variance.
    </p>
    <p>This tool can also work with data that is time-enabled. If time is enabled on the input points, then the time slicing options are available. Time slicing allows you to calculate the point-in-area relationship while looking at a specific slice in time. For example, you could look at hourly intervals, which would result in outputs for each hour. 
    </p>
    <p>For an example with time, suppose you had point features of every transaction made at various coffee shop locations and no  area layer. The data has been recorded over a year and each transaction has a location and a time stamp. Assuming each transaction has a <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> attribute, you can get the sum of all <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> within the space and time of interest. If these transactions are for a single city, we could generate  areas that  are 1-kilometer grids and look at weekly time slices to summarize the transactions in both time and space.

        <div>
            <p>If time is enabled on the input point layer and it is of type instant, you can  analyze using time slicing.  There are three parameters you can set when you use time:
                <ul>
                    <li>  <b>Time Interval</b>
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Time Step</b>
                    </li>
                    <li> <b>Reference Time</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>Imagine you had data that represented a year in time and you wanted to analyze using weekly slices. To do that you would set  <b>Time Interval</b> to <code>1 week</code>.
            </p>
            <p> Imagine you had data that represented a year in time and you wanted to analyze using the first week of the month. To do that you would set <b>Time Interval</b> to <code>1 week</code>, <b>Time Step</b> to <code>1 month</code>, and <b>Reference Time</b> to <code>January 1, at 12:00 am</code>.
            </p>

    <div id="timeInterval">

        <div>
            <p>Interval of time used for slicing the data. Time interval may be used alone or used with the  <b>Time Step</b> or <b>Reference Time</b> parameter.
            </p>
            <p> If you wanted to create time slices that took place every Monday from 9:00 a.m. until 10:00 a.m., <b>Time Interval</b> would be <code>1 hour</code>, <b>Time Step</b> would be <code>1 week</code>, and <b>Reference Time</b> would be <code>9:00:00 a.m. on a Monday</code>.

        <div>
            <p> You can calculate statistics on features that are summarized. On numeric fields you can calculate the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count
                    </li>

                    <li>Min
                    </li>
                    <li>Max
                    </li>
                    <li>Range
                    </li>
                    <li>Variance
                    </li>
                    <li>Standard deviation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>On string fields you can calculate the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Count
                    </li>
                    <li>Any&mdash;This statistic is a random sample of a string value in the specified field.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                All statistics are calculated on nonnull values. The resulting layer will contain a new field for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic.

        <div>
            <p>This is a temporary parameter for prerelease  to set the processing spatial reference. Many big data tools require that a projected coordinate system is used as the spatial reference for processing. By default, the tool will use the input coordinate system but will fail if it's a geographic coordinate system. To set a projected coordinate system, enter the WKID. For example,  <b>Web Mercator</b> would be entered as <code>3857</code>.
